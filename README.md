Maximum Value of the Loot


Given the capacity of a backpack as well as the weights and per pound prices of n
n
 different compounds, compute the maximum total price of items that fit into the backpack of the given capacity.

A thief breaks into a spice shop and finds four pounds of saffron, three pounds of vanilla, and five pounds of cinnamon. His backpack fits at most nine pounds, therefore he cannot take everything. Assuming that the prices of saffron, vanilla, and cinnamon are 5000, 200, and 10 per pound respectively, what is the most valuable loot in this case? If the thief takes u1

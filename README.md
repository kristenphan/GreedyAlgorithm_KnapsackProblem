__Assignment 1 description: Maximum value of the knapsack__

Given the capacity of a backpack as well as the weights and per pound prices of n different compounds, compute the maximum total price of items that fit into the backpack of the given capacity.

A thief breaks into a spice shop and finds four pounds of saffron, three pounds of vanilla, and five pounds of cinnamon. His backpack fits at most nine pounds, therefore he cannot take everything. Assuming that the prices of saffron, vanilla, and cinnamon are 5000, 200, and 10 per pound respectively, what is the most valuable loot in this case? If the thief takes u1 pounds of saffron, u2 pounds of vanilla, and u3 pounds of cinnamon, the total price of the loot is 5,000⋅u1+200⋅u2+10⋅u3. The thief would like to maximize the value of this expression subject to the following constraints: u1≤4, u2≤3, u3≤5, u1+u2+u3≤9



__Assignment description2: Car fueling__

Compute the minimum number of tank refills to get from one city to another. Assuming that the distance between the cities is 1≤d≤10 miles, a car can travel at most 1≤m≤400 miles on a full tank, and there are 1≤n≤300 gas stations at distances stop1,stop2,…,stop along the way, output the minimum number of refills needed. Assume that the car starts with a full tank. If it is not possible to reach the destination, output −1. The distances to gas stations satisfy the inequalities 0<stop1<stop2<⋯<stopn<d.

Plus, once you're worked your heart out and was able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you gained from such experience is priceless :)
